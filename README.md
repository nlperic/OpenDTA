# OpenDTA
An open source solver for dynamic traffic assignment

# About

* Two dynamic network loading schemes are implemented:
  - Cell transmission model with [Nie et al's node model](http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/nie/nie-diss.pdf)
  - A customized dynamic network loading model, which is a refined version of our [previous paper](https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=1439609).
* Two assignment methods are given:
  - Method of successive average (MSA)
  - Variational inequalities (VI)
  
I am sorry that this repository is still empty because our paper is still under review. I would upload the code soon after the paper be accepted (with finger crossed).
